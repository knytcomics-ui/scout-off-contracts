---

## registration

Handles player and scout on-chain identity.

| Function | Auth | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `initialize(admin)` | admin | One-time setup |
| `register_player(wallet, vitals, ipfs_hashes)` | wallet | Create player profile at Level 0 |
| `update_profile(player_id, ipfs_hashes)` | player wallet | Update IPFS content hashes |
| `register_scout(wallet, region)` | wallet | Create scout profile |
| `get_player(player_id)` | — | Read player profile |

### Dual-Role Wallet Policy

A single wallet address **may register as both a player and a scout**. This is intentional and allowed. A wallet can hold both roles simultaneously without restriction. Duplicate prevention is enforced per role (a wallet cannot register twice as a player, and cannot register twice as a scout), but cross-role registration is permitted.
